## QuickNN

This is a NN I wrote for AIM quickly during Linear Algebra this is not very good but hey that's fine we're learning you know.

Somethings to note / add: first of all we need to add training with gradient descent I know that I have my loss function already, need to add d_sigmoid as well.
